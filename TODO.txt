Next Step: 

	Deliver no metrics at the first fetch
	Logging
	ExceptionHandling
	Verify the benefit of yield as there is only one occurance in a method.
	PreviousPlanCacheItemStore could only store the execution count.
	Handle Last execution Count in provider
	Fix TODOs in PlanCacheRepositoryAdapter.
	Optimize script for extracting historical data so that DateAdd function is not calles in where clause
	Fix issue:
		An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
		System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key '597577167' was not present in the dictionary.
		at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)
		Reproduce: Add stored procedure where the metrics exporter has no rights.
