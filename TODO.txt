Next Step: 
	
	Upgrade top .Net 6
	Enable loading additional configuration from config folder (satisfy standard deployment)
	Change name of metrics to pattern MSSQL_AverageElapsedTime{storedProcedure="AssignAdmiralCard"}
	Deliver no metrics at the first fetch
	Logging
	ExceptionHandling
	Verify the benefit of yield as there is only one occurance in a method.
	PreviousPlanCacheItemStore could only store the execution count.
	Handle Last execution Count in provider
	Remove TrustServerCertificate=True from connection string for local host (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/663116/a-connection-was-successfully-established-with-the-1.html)
	Fix TODOs in PlanCacheRepositoryAdapter.
	Optimize script for extracting historical data so that DateAdd function is not calles in where clause
	Fix issue: 
		When app crashes the historical statistics are not reset to the newest values. Consequerntly all future calls are executed with the same collection range.
		TODO: find a solution/strategy to handle this.

	(Done) Fix issue:
		An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
		System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key '597577167' was not present in the dictionary.
		at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)
		Reproduce: Add stored procedure where the metrics exporter has no rights.
		Reason: The stored procedure was available only for a short time (e.g.: created by integration tests and removed in tear down). The app craches because it is
		        still emitted by the historical (maybe also by plan cache) query but not but query in sys objects, so that it can be loaded into the dictionary.
		Suggest: Ignore non existing Stored procedures.
	(Done) Implement ZeroItem FactoryMethod for PlanCacheItem.
	(Done) Clone and move XMl Classes for deserialization.
	(Done) Clean Up NameSpaces SqlServer <=> SqlServer
	(Done) Implement StandardPreviousItemCache.
	(Done) Remove DeltatMetricsBuilder
	(Done) Complete GetHistoricalItems From Cache (XML Deserailiation is missing)
	(Done) Integrate objectId/Name mappings call 
	(Done) Creation of DbPlanCacheItemRepositoryAdapter
	(Done) Make path of Collect in ProcedureMetricsProvider async
